# Apollo Package

The purpose of this package is to provide utils that works well with apollo client.
One of the utils are:

- Custom useQuery, useLazyQuery and useMutation hooks to prevent future migration if we will change the data layer by just adjusting this hooks

- Updating cache functions , to update existing queries without refetching the data from the API.
