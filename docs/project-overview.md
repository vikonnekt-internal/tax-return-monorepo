# Project Overview

## Introduction

The Tax ID Return System is a comprehensive application designed to facilitate tax filing and management. It allows users to view their tax information, submit tax returns, and manage their tax-related data. The system integrates with government data sources and provides a user-friendly interface for taxpayers to interact with their tax information.

## Key Features

- **User Authentication**: Secure login and registration system with email verification.
- **Taxpayer Information Management**: View and update personal information.
- **Tax Return Filing**: Create, edit, and submit tax returns.
- **Income Source Tracking**: Manage various sources of income.
- **Asset Management**: Track real estate properties and vehicles.
- **Debt Tracking**: Record housing loans and other debts.
- **Benefit Management**: Track received benefits.
- **Government Data Integration**: Sync with government records for pre-filled information.
- **Tax Calculation**: Automatic calculation of tax liability or refund amounts.
- **Status Tracking**: Monitor the status of submitted tax returns.

## Target Users

- **Individual Taxpayers**: Citizens who need to file tax returns.
- **Tax Professionals**: Accountants and tax advisors who assist clients with tax filing.
- **Government Officials**: Tax administration staff who need to review and process tax returns.

## Monorepo Structure

The project is structured as a monorepo using Turborepo, allowing for efficient management of multiple packages and applications:

- **Apps**: Contains the frontend (web), API (backend), and other applications.
- **Packages**: Contains shared libraries and configurations used across applications.

## Development Approach

The system follows modern development practices:

- **TypeScript**: Strong typing throughout the codebase.
- **Microservices Architecture**: Separation of concerns through modular services.
- **GraphQL API**: Flexible and efficient data fetching.
- **RESTful Endpoints**: For specific operation types.
- **Prisma ORM**: Type-safe database access.
- **Next.js Frontend**: React-based frontend with server-side rendering capabilities.
- **NestJS Backend**: Scalable and maintainable backend architecture.

## Deployment Strategy

The system is designed to be deployed using Docker containers, with separate services for the frontend, backend, and database. This allows for scalability and easier maintenance.
